=== Django socialregistration ===

before installing on debian, to stop ezzhtools from messing about,
downloading django 1.1 when it was already installed, the ezzhtools
install_requires line was removed and apt-get install python-oauth
and apt-get install python-paste had already been done and were now
not interfered with.

however, it appears that there is a problem with python-openid on
debian, so that was installed manually from the site:
http://openidenabled.com/python-openid/

Also, django socialregistration, in order to actually, like... work,
required zip_safe=False to be added, so that the templates folder
was accessible.
